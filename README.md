# REACT-D3-POLLTRACKER

# based on react-tutorial, see initial facebook comment in script 
# also based on the geoAlbers map for d3 and uses us.json

# completely changed to create a dynamic polltracker
# current example is a random based poll simulating US presidential elections
# but this structure could be adapted for any poll, for example using google adword ads
